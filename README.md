Provided code for the authorization (oauth2) protocol for Google
calendars. There is also a picker for a date range. 
The program allows the user to choose calendars (a single
user may have several Google calendars, one of which is the 'primary'
calendar) and list 'blocking'  (non-transparent)
appointments between a start date and an end date
for some subset of them.
